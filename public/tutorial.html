        <h1>Section 1</h1>
        <p>Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is 
          a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess 
          his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. To say his life is "miserable" 
          is an understatement. But one day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive 
          spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a 
          muscle-bound physique, clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting 
          webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn 
          administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin 
          emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else
           Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will 
           survive at the end.</p>

            (Robertson), Parkers decides to put his new skills to use in order to rid the city of evil, but 
            someone else has other plans. The Green Goblin (Dafoe) sees Spider-Man as a threat and must 
            dispose of him. Even if it means the Goblin has to target Parker's Aunt (Harris) and the girl

             him. Peter's only friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco), who, though rich and good-looking, is 
             milarly an outcast. Harry, however, is somewhat jealous of the affection his father, Norman 
             (Willem Dafoe) shows Peter. Norman, the head of weapons contractor Oscorp, appreciates Peter's 
             scientific aptitude and can barely conceal his desire that Peter was his own son
